# JSON parse
## Descripition
#### 1. Retrieve JSON, parse, and print information on page
#### 2. My project have one entity: employee
#### 3. Use JSONObject to parse JSON file retrieve from provided URL
#### 4. Use stream api complete two features: sorted and filter

## Bug and Problem
#### 1. Response error: 429 Too Many Requests
#### 2. At first time, about rest template, can not understand why getForObject() and getForEntity() return object; At last find out I can define any return class I want process; I choose String, but still don't know how to implement logic if I use Object.
#### 3. Did not use POJO; Map entity with JSON in JasonParseService; Use POJO could be better.
